"If you are completely new to programming, try these initial problems to learn a few 
basics about the Python programming language. You'll get familiar with the operations 
needed to start solving bioinformatics challenges in the Stronghold."

The description above is cited directly form ROSALIND describing this problem set.
Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving.
